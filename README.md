This is a nice webpage to decide, whether you use:
- VPN
- Pries
- TOR Network
- Relays

It also shows you the city you live in. Check out the code, your IP won't get logged in any way. I use the [vpnapi](https://vpnapi.io/) API. It has a rate limit, so don't wonder if the site doesn't work.
Enjoy.
